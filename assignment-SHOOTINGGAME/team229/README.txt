			Make and Build
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In your terminal, go to the "team229" directory. Use the command 
"make program" to make and build the game. If a warning shows saying 
there is no device present, reset your UCFunkit and retry the command.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
		       Starting the Game
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first menu you will see is a game menu which allows you to choose 
to either play Castle Defender or Paper Scissors Rock Lizard Vulcan
(currently in the Beta stage of development). Moving the joystick up and
down changes the options, and pushing the joystick down selects your 
game. Select the Castle Defender game. 

The next menu is to select if you would like to play with 1 player or 2.
Again, moving the joystick up and down scrolls through your options, and
pushing it down will confirm your selection. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Single Player
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If single player is selected, then you begin with an LED brightly lit on
the right side of the screen. This is you. The objective of the game is 
to shoot the quickly flashing, duller LEDs that drop from the top of the
screen. You can move up and down using the joystick (you cannot move 
from side to side) and you can shoot across the screen by pushing the 
joystick down. As your arrow gets further away from you it experiences a
slight drop. You can only fire the next arrow once the previous one 
leaves the screen or hits an enemy. If an enemy reaches the bottom then 
it will appear below you and will block you from moving down onto it or 
below it. The enemies have over run the castle when when they occupy 
every space on the right side of the screen and the game over screen 
will play. You can then return to the Castle Defender menu by pushing 
down the joystick.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
			Two Player
------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to play two player then you must have 2 UCFunkits connected 
and you must run the game for each UCFunkit. Choose one person to be 
player 1 and the other to be player 2 by scrolling through the Castle 
Defender menu. Player 1 is similar to single player, shooting the 
enemies as they come down the screen. Player 2 has an enemy at the
bottom of their screen that can move the length of the screen using the
joystick. Player 2's objective is to select when and where the enemies
are being dropped for Player 1. Dropping an enemy can be done by pushing
in the joystick. Player 2 is limited to 3 enemies at one time.
